1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game
Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.
"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that moves is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first.

Example 1:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: "A" wins, he always plays first.
"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " X "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OOX"

Example 2:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: "B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XXO"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "XO " 
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "O  "
