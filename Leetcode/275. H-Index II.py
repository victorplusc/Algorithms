275. H-Index II
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:
If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:
This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

# Time complexity: O(log N)
# Space complexity: O(1)
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        left, right = 0, n
        
        most = 0
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            diff = n - mid
            if citations[mid] >= diff:
                most = diff
                right = mid
            elif citations[mid] < diff:
                left = mid + 1
        return most
